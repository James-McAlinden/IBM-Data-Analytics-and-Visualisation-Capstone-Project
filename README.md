**IBM Data Analytics and Visualisation Capstone Project

In this Capstone Project course, I applied a variety of data analytics skills that I learnt as part of the previous courses.

The following tasks I completed were:
•	Collecting data from multiple sources using APIs and web scraping.
•	Completing exploratory data analysis. This includes finding the distribution of data, the presence of outliers, and the correlation between different columns of data.
•	Wrangling and preparing the data. This involved identifying duplicate rows, finding missing values, and normalising data.
•	Mining and analysing the data.
•	Visualising data using graphs and plots.
•	Using IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard.
•	Presenting the data in a report format. 

I analysed the data to identify insights and trends to answer two key questions:
•	What are the top programming languages in demand?
•	What are the top database skills in demand?
